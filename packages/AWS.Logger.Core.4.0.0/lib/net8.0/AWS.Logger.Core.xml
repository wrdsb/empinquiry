            This class contains all the configuration options for logging messages to AWS. As messages from the application are 
            sent to the logger they are queued up in a batch. The batch will be sent when either BatchPushInterval or BatchSizeInBytes
            are exceeded.
            
            <para>
            AWS Credentials are determined using the following steps.
            1) If the Credentials property is set
            2) If the Profile property is set and the can be found
            3) Use the AWS SDK for .NET fall back mechanism to find enviroment credentials.

            Determines whether or not to create a new Log Group, if the one specified by <see cref="P:AWS.Logger.AWSLoggerConfig.LogGroup"/> doesn't already exist
            If false (the default), the Log Group is created if it doesn't already exist. This requires logs:DescribeLogGroups
            permission to determine if the group exists, and logs:CreateLogGroup permission to create the group if it doesn't already exist.
            If true, creation of Log Groups is disabled. Logging functions only if the specified log group already exists.
            When creation of log groups is disabled, logs:DescribeLogGroups permission is NOT required.

            newly created log groups. The default value of <c>null</c> will not apply a retention policy to new log groups.

            Note that log groups which already exist will not have this retention policy applied for startup performance reasons.

            <remarks>
            We defer the initialization of the client until it is first accessed. This avoids a deadlock for log4net:
              1. The thread creating the logger (which contains the CWL client) gets an internal lock in log4net, then tries to 
                 access SDK configuration via the static FallbackInternalConfigurationFactory.
              2. The timer thread the SDK uses to load EC2 IMDS credentials requests SDK configuration via 
                 FallbackInternalConfigurationFactory, which attempts to create additional loggers for logging the configuration loading.
            There's an implicit lock around FallbackInternalConfigurationFactory's static constructor, so these two threads deadlock.
            
            By delaying initializing the internal client, we delay starting thread 2 until thread 1 has finished, that way we're 
            not creating additional log4net loggers in FallbackInternalConfigurationFactory while another thread is holding the log4net lock.

            Specifies the days to retain events in log groups which are created by this logger, if the one specified by <see cref="P:AWS.Logger.IAWSLoggerConfig.LogGroup"/> doesn't already exist
            and <see cref="P:AWS.Logger.IAWSLoggerConfig.DisableLogGroupCreation"/> is not <c>true</c>. Requires logs:PutRetentionPolicy permission to apply the retention policy to
            newly created log groups. The default value of <c>null</c> will not apply a retention policy to new log groups.
            <para>
            Note that log groups which already exist will not have this retention policy applied for startup performance reasons.
            </para>
            <para>
            Possible values could be found in the CloudWatchLogs API reference at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_PutRetentionPolicy.html#API_PutRetentionPolicy_RequestSyntax

            </summary>
            <remarks>
            Note that invalid retention policy values will result in the policy not being applied, however this error is non-fatal and the application and will continue without the policy.

            Gets the ProfilesLocation property. If this is not set the default profile store is used by the AWS SDK for .NET 
            to look up credentials. This is most commonly used when you are running an application of on-priemse under a service account.

            Gets the Region property. This is the AWS Region that will be used for CloudWatch Logs. If this is not
            the AWS SDK for .NET will use its fall back logic to try and determine the region through environment variables and EC2 instance metadata.
            If the Region is not set and no region is found by the SDK's fall back logic then an exception will be thrown.

            <summary>
            Gets the BatchPushInterval property. For performance the log messages are sent to AWS in batch sizes. BatchPushInterval
